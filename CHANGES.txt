=====

* test harness
* more test coverage
* flake8 cleaning

0.4.2

* merged with the version that was on github, which had gotten
  slightly out of sync

0.4.1
=====

* typo fix

0.4.0
=====

* initial south migrations are now included.
  WARNING: this means that if you upgrade to this version
           on an app that is using south, you will need to
           run a fake migration once so it doesn't try to
           do duplicate table creation stuff. something like:

    $ ./manage.py migrate courseaffils --fake


0.3.1
=====

* switch to semantic versioning (0.3.1 vs 0.3dev)
* change package name from django_courseaffils to django-courseaffils
* add unit tests for the models
* some flake8 cleanup

0.2
===

Middleware now sets `request.actual_course_object` as well as `request.course` (which is, misleadingly, a Group)
