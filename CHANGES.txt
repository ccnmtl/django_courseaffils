* initial south migrations are now included.
  WARNING: this means that if you upgrade to this version
           on an app that is using south, you will need to
           run a fake migration once so it doesn't try to
           do duplicate table creation stuff. something like:

    $ ./manage.py migrate courseaffils --fake
